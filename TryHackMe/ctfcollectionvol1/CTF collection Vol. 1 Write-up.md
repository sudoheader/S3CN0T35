# CTF Collection Vol. 1 Write-up

Sharpening up your CTF skill with the collection. The first volume is designed for beginner.

### Task 2: What does the base said?

Can you decode the following?

VEhNe2p1NTdfZDNjMGQzXzdoM19iNDUzfQ==

Try this in your terminal:
```bash
echo VEhNe2p1NTdfZDNjMGQzXzdoM19iNDUzfQ== | base64 -d
```

Which will display the line of encoded text and pipe the output to `base64 -d` to decode it.
